{"content": "The first instance, firstName is what we use as the names of variables. Remember though, firstName is not the same as FirstName because Java is case-sensitive. Case-sensitive basically implies that the case in which you wrote one word is the case you have to call that word in when using them later on. Anything other than that is not the same as you intended. You'll know more as you progress. You can hopefully tell now why the variables you were asked to identify weren't proper.\n", "stemmed": "the first instanc , firstnam use name variabl . rememb though , firstnam firstnam java case-sensit . case-sensit basic impli case wrote one word case call word use later . anyth intend . you 'll know progress . you hope tell variabl ask identifi n't proper .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Variables"}
