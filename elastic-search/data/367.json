{"content": "The division operator rounds towards zero: 5/2 is 2, and -5/2 is -2.\nThe remainder operator has the same sign as the left operand; it is defined such that ((a/b)*b) + (a%b) is always equal to a.\nThe preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement operators are special: they also change the value of the variable, by adding or subtracting one. The only difference is that preincrement/decrement returns the new value of the variable; postincrement returns the original value of the variable.\n", "stemmed": "the divis oper round toward zero : 5/2 2 , -5/2 -2 . the remaind oper sign left operand ; defin ( ( a/b ) *b ) + ( % b ) alway equal . the preincrement , predecr , postincr , postdecr oper special : also chang valu variabl , ad subtract one . the differ preincrement/decr return new valu variabl ; postincr return origin valu variabl .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Arithmetic_expressions"}
