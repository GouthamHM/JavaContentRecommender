{"content": "The primitive types are used to represent boolean, character, and numeric values. This program uses only one primitive type explicitly, int, which represents 32 bit signed integer values. The program also implicitly uses double, which is the return type of the distance() method of java.awt.Point. double values are 64 bit IEEE floating point values. The main() method uses integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3 to access elements of the command line arguments. The Distance() constructor's four parameters also have the type int. Also, the intValue() method has a return type of int. This means a call to that method, such as intValue(args[0]), is an expression of type int. This helps explain why the main method cannot call:\n", "stemmed": "the primit type use repres boolean , charact , numer valu . thi program use one primit type explicitli , int , repres 32 bit sign integ valu . the program also implicitli use doubl , return type distanc ( ) method java.awt.point . doubl valu 64 bit ieee float point valu . the main ( ) method use integ valu 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 access element command line argument . the distanc ( ) constructor 's four paramet also type int . also , intvalu ( ) method return type int . thi mean call method , intvalu ( arg [ 0 ] ) , express type int . thi help explain main method call :", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Understanding_a_Java_Program"}
