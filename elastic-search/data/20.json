{"content": "It should be noted that the execution of the Thread didn't occur in the desired order. Instead of the order t1\u2013t2\u2013t3, the threads executed in the order of t1\u2013t3\u2013t2. The order in which the threads are executed is completely dependent on the operating system and may change for every execution of the program, thus making output of multithreaded application difficult to predict and control. Some people suggest that this is the major reason that adds to the complexity of multithreaded programming and its debugging. However, it should be observed that once the threads were put to sleep using the Thread.sleep(...) function, the execution intervals and order can be predicted quite capably. The thread with the least amount of sleeping time was t2 (\"Thread-2\") with 189 milliseconds of sleep hence it got called first. Then t1 was called and finally t3 was called.\n", "stemmed": "It note execut thread n't occur desir order . instead order t1\u2013t2\u2013t3 , thread execut order t1\u2013t3\u2013t2 . the order thread execut complet depend oper system may chang everi execut program , thu make output multithread applic difficult predict control . some peopl suggest major reason add complex multithread program debug . howev , observ thread put sleep use thread.sleep ( ... ) function , execut interv order predict quit capabl . the thread least amount sleep time t2 ( `` thread-2 '' ) 189 millisecond sleep henc got call first . then t1 call final t3 call .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Threads_and_Runnables"}
