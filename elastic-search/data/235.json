{"content": "The difference between the above and below code is that the above code checks\nto see if the String's are the same objects in memory which they are. This is as a result of the fact that\nString's are stored in a place in memory called the String Constant Pool. If the new keyword is not explicitly used when \ncreating the String it checks to see if it already exists in the Pool and uses the existing one. If it does not exist, a new Object is created. This is what allows Strings to be immutable in Java.\nTo test for equality, use the equals(Object) method inherited by every class and defined by String to return true if and only if the object passed in is a String contains the exact same data:\n", "stemmed": "the differ code code check see string 's object memori . thi result fact string 's store place memori call string constant pool .
