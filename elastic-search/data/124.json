{"content": "The Java class libraries serve three purposes within the Java platform.  Like other standard code libraries, they provide the programmer with a well-known set of functions to perform common tasks, such as maintaining lists of items or performing complex string parsing.  In addition, the class libraries provide an abstract interface to tasks that would normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system.  Tasks such as network access and file access are often heavily dependent on the native capabilities of the platform.  The Java java.net and java.io libraries implement the required native code internally, then provide a standard interface for the Java applications to perform those tasks.  Finally, some underlying platforms may not support all of the features a Java application expects.  In these cases, the class libraries can either emulate those features using whatever is available, or provide a consistent way to check for the presence of a specific feature.\n", "stemmed": "the java class librari serv three purpos within java platform . like standard code librari , provid programm well-known set function perform common task , maintain list item perform complex string pars .
