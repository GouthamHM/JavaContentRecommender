{"content": "A package is a name space that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class ArrayList is in the package java.util. For this class, java.util.ArrayList is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes java.util.Date and java.sql.Date which are not the same. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.\n", "stemmed": "A packag name space mainli contain class interfac . for instanc , standard class arraylist packag java.util . for class , java.util.arraylist call fulli qualifi name syntax ambigu . class differ packag name . for exampl , two class java.util.d java.sql.d .
