While condition statements\nevaluate to a boolean value, that is, either true or false. As long as the condition is\ntrue, the loop will iterate the block of code over and over and again. Once the condition evaluates\nto false, the loop exits to the next statement outside the loop.\n", "stemmed": "here condit express .
