{"content": "\nAside from the java.util.Collection interface, the Java JDK has the java.util.Map interface as well.  It is sometimes also called an Associated Array or a Dictionary.  A map defines key value mappings.  Implementations of the Map interface do not contain collections of objects.  Instead they contain collections of key->value mappings.  It can be thought of as an array where the index doesn't need to be an integer.\n", "stemmed": "asid java.util.collect interfac , java jdk java.util.map interfac well .
