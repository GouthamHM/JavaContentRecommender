{"content": "The encoding used for the NewStringUTF, GetStringUTFLength, GetStringUTFChars, ReleaseStringUTFChars, GetStringUTFRegion functions is not standard UTF-8, but modified UTF-8. The null character (U+0000) and codepoints greater than or equal to U+10000 are encoded differently in modified UTF-8. Many programs actually use these functions incorrectly and treat the UTF-8 strings returned or passed into the functions as standard UTF-8 strings instead of modified UTF-8 strings. Programs should use the NewString, GetStringLength, GetStringChars, ReleaseStringChars, GetStringRegion, GetStringCritical, and ReleaseStringCritical functions, which use UTF-16LE encoding on little-endian architectures and UTF-16BE on big-endian architectures, and then use a UTF-16 to standard UTF-8 conversion routine.\n", "stemmed": "the encod use newstringutf , getstringutflength , getstringutfchar , releasestringutfchar , getstringutfregion function standard utf-8 , modifi utf-8 . the null charact ( u+0000 ) codepoint greater equal u+10000 encod differ modifi utf-8 . mani program actual use function incorrectli treat utf-8 string return pass function standard utf-8 string instead modifi utf-8 string . program use newstr , getstringlength , getstringchar , releasestringchar , getstringregion , getstringcrit , releasestringcrit function , use utf-16l encod little-endian architectur utf-16b big-endian architectur , use utf-16 standard utf-8 convers routin .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Native_Interface"}
