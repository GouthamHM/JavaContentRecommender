{"content": "The java.lang.Object.equals(java.lang.Object) method compares the object to another object and returns a boolean result indicating if the two objects are equal.  Semantically, this method compares the contents of the objects whereas the equality comparison operator \"==\" compares the object references.  The equals method is used by many of the data structure classes in the java.util package.  Some of these data structure classes also rely on the Object.hashCode method\u2014see the hashCode method for details on the contract between equals and hashCode. Implementing equals() isn't always as easy as it seems, see 'Secrets of equals()' for more information.\n", "stemmed": "the java.lang.object.equ ( java.lang.object ) method compar object anoth object return boolean result indic two object equal . semant , method compar content object wherea equal comparison oper `` == '' compar object refer . the equal method use mani data structur class java.util packag . some data structur class also reli object.hashcod method\u2014se hashcod method detail contract equal hashcod . implement equal ( ) n't alway easi seem , see 'secret equal ( ) ' inform .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Classes,_Objects_and_Types"}
