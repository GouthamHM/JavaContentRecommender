{"content": "In the code listing 4.15 we used cloning for speed up object creation. Another use of cloning could be to take a snapshot of an object that can change in time. Let's say we want to store Customer objects in a collection, but we want to disassociate them from the 'live' objects.  So before adding the object, we clone them, so if the original object changes from that point forward, the added object won't.  Also let's say that the Customer object has a reference to an Activity object that contains the customer activities.  Now we are facing a problem, it is not enough to clone the Customer object, we also need to clone the referenced objects.  The solution:\n", "stemmed": "In code list 4.15 use clone speed object creation . anoth use clone could take snapshot object chang time . let 's say want store custom object collect , want disassoci 'live ' object .
