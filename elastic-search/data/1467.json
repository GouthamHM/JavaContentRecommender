{"content": "Java has various inbuilt streams implemented as classes in the package java.io like the classes of System.in and System.out. Streams can be classed as both input and output streams. All Java streams are derived from Input Stream (java.io.InputStream) and Output Stream (java.io.OutputStream) classes. They are abstract base classes meant for other stream classes. The System.in is the input stream class derivative and analogically System.out is the output counterpart. Both are basic classes used to directly interact with input and output through console, similarly follows System.err. Also Java has streams to communicate across different parts of a program or even among threads. There are also classes that \"filter\" streams, changing one format to another (e.g. class DataOutputStream, which translates various primitive types to byte streams).\n", "stemmed": "java variou inbuilt stream implement class packag java.io like class system.in system.out . stream class input output stream . all java stream deriv input stream ( java.io.inputstream ) output stream ( java.io.outputstream ) class . they abstract base class meant stream class . the system.in input stream class deriv analog system.out output counterpart . both basic class use directli interact input output consol , similarli follow system.err . also java stream commun across differ part program even among thread . there also class `` filter '' stream , chang one format anoth ( e.g . class dataoutputstream , translat variou primit type byte stream ) .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Streams"}
