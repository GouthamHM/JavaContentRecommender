{"content": "For the purposes of bringing color to our drawing, we used a method namely the setColor(Color) method. This method comes into force for all the drawing made after its call until another color is set. It asks for an argument of type Color. Now because you have no idea of how to actually instantiate a Color class, the class itself has a few built-in colors. Some built-in colors that you can use are mentioned below.\n", "stemmed": "for purpos bring color draw , use method name setcolor ( color ) method . thi method come forc draw made call anoth color set .
