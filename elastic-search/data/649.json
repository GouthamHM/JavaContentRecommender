If the mutex lock is currently held by another thread, the current thread is added to the list of blocked threads waiting on the mutex lock.  The other wait list is used for signaling between threads accomplished through the wait and notify and notifyAll methods.\n", "stemmed": "everi object two wait list thread associ . one wait list use synchron keyword acquir mutex lock associ object .
