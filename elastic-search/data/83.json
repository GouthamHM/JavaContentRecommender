{"content": "The Garbage Collector is always running. This automatic memory garbage collection feature makes it easy to write robust server side programs in Java. The only thing the programmer has to watch for is the speed of object creation. If the application is creating objects faster than the Garbage Collector can free them, it can cause memory problems. Depending on how the JVM is configured, the application either can run out of memory by throwing the NotEnoughMemoryException, or can halt to give time for the Garbage Collector to do its job.\n", "stemmed": "the garbag collector alway run . thi automat memori garbag collect featur make easi write robust server side program java . the thing programm watch speed object creation .
