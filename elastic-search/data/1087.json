Thus, the instance of obj will be a MyClass or a SubOfMyClass depending on the execution time. So it is impossible to determine the method address at compile time. Because the obj reference can point to an object and all its sub objects, and that will be known only at runtime, a table is kept with all the possible method addresses to be called.
