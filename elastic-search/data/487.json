{"content": "In Java, numbers are dealt with using data types specially formulated to host numeric data. But before we dive into these types, we must first set some concepts in stone. Just like you did in high school (or even primary school), numbers in Java are placed in clearly distinct groups and systems. As you'd already know by now, number systems includes groups like the integer numbers (0, 1, 2 ... \u221e); negative integers (0, -1, -2 ... -\u221e) or even real and rational numbers (value of Pi, \u00be, 0.333~, etcetera). Java simply tends to place these numbers in two distinct groups, integers (-\u221e ... 0 ... \u221e) and floating point numbers (any number with decimal points or fractional representation). For the moment, we would only look into integer values as they are easier to understand and work with.\n", "stemmed": "In java , number dealt use data type special formul host numer data . but dive type , must first set concept stone . just like high school ( even primari school ) , number java place clearli distinct group system .
