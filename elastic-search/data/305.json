{"content": "It is all good, but this way, we can only host positive numbers (or unsigned integers). They are called unsigned integers. Unsigned integers are whole number values that are all positive and do not attribute to negative values. For this very reason, we would ask one of the 8 bits to hold information about the sign of the number (positive or negative). This leaves us with just 7 bits to actually count out a number. The maximum number that these 7 bits can hold (1111111) is 127 in the decimal system.\n", "stemmed": "It good , way , host posit number ( unsign integ ) . they call unsign integ . unsign integ whole number valu posit attribut neg valu . for reason , would ask one 8 bit hold inform sign number ( posit neg ) . thi leav us 7 bit actual count number . the maximum number 7 bit hold ( 1111111 ) 127 decim system .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Primitive_Types"}
