{"content": "A copy constructor is not included in the Java language, however one can easily create a constructor that does the same as a copy constructor. It's important to understand what it is. As the name implies, a copy constructor creates a new instance to be a duplicate of an already existing one. In Java, this can be also accomplished by creating the instance with the default constructor, and then using the assignment operator to equivocate them. This is not possible in all languages though, so just keep the terminology under your belt.\n", "stemmed": "A copi constructor includ java languag , howev one easili creat constructor copi constructor .
