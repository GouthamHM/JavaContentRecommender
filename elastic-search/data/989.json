{"content": "In a class, there can be several methods with the same name. However they must have a different signature. The signature of a method is comprised of its name, its parameter types and the order of its parameters. The signature of a method is not comprised of its return type nor its visibility nor the exceptions it may throw.\nThe practice of defining two or more methods within the same class that share the same name but have different parameters is called overloading methods.  \n", "stemmed": "In class , sever method name . howev must differ signatur . the signatur method compris name , paramet type order paramet . the signatur method compris return type visibl except may throw . the practic defin two method within class share name differ paramet call overload method .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Overloading_Methods_and_Constructors"}
