{"content": "The reason for this diversion is that Java is not 100% object-oriented and discerns between \"simple\" and \"complex\" types. These will be handled in detail in the following sections. An example for a simple type is the byte type. An example for a complex type is a class. A subset of the complex types are classes that cannot be modified after creation, like a String, which is a concatenation of characters.\n", "stemmed": "the reason divers java 100 % object-ori discern `` simpl '' `` complex '' type . these handl detail follow section .
