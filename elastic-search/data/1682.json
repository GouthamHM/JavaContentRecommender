{"content": "J# is normally not supported with the JVM because instead of compiling it in Java byte-code, the .NET platform compiles the code into CIL, thus making J# different from the Java programming language. Furthermore, because J# implements the .NET Base Class Libraries (BCL) instead of the Java Class Libraries, J# is nothing more than a non-standard extension of the Java programming language. Due to the lack of interest from developers, Microsoft had to withdraw their support for J#, and focused on a similar programming language: C#.\n", "stemmed": "J # normal support jvm instead compil java byte-cod , .net platform compil code cil , thu make J # differ java program languag . furthermor , J # implement .net base class librari ( bcl ) instead java class librari , J # noth non-standard extens java program languag . due lack interest develop , microsoft withdraw support J # , focus similar program languag : C # .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform"}
