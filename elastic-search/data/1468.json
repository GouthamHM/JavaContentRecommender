{"content": "It is a characteristic of streams that they deal only in one discrete unit of data at a time, and different streams deal with different types of data.  If one had a stream that represented a destination for bytes, for example, one would send data to the destination one byte at a time.  If a stream was a source of byte data, one would read the data a byte at a time.  Because this is the only way to access data from a stream, in this latter case, we wouldn't know when we had read all the data from the stream until we actually got there.  When reading a stream, one generally has to check each unit of data each read operation to see if the end of the stream has been reached (with byte streams, the special value is the integer -1, or FFFF hex).\n", "stemmed": "It characterist stream deal one discret unit data time , differ stream deal differ type data .
