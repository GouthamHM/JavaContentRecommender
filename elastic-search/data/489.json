{"content": "Lets see how this new found knowledge of the basic integer types in Java fits into the picture. Say, you want to numerically manipulate the days in a year \u2014 all 365 days. What type would you use? Since the data type byte only goes up to 127, would you risk giving it a value greater than its allowed maximum. Such decisions might save you from dreaded errors that might occur out of the programmed code. A much more sensible choice for such a numeric operation might be a short. Oh, why couldn't they make just one data type to hold all kinds of numbers? Wouldn't you ask that question? Well, let's explore why.\n", "stemmed": "let see new found knowledg basic integ type java fit pictur . say , want numer manipul day year \u2014 365 day . what type would use ? sinc data type byte goe 127 , would risk give valu greater allow maximum . such decis might save dread error might occur program code .
