{"content": "The two assignments in this constructor use Java's new operator to allocate two java.awt.Point objects. The first allocates an object representing the first point, (x0, y0), and assigns it to the point0 instance variable (replacing the null value that the instance variable was initialized to). The second statement allocates a second java.awt.Point instance with (x1, y1) and assigns it to the point1 instance variable.\n", "stemmed": "the two assign constructor use java 's new oper alloc two java.awt.point object . the first alloc object repres first point , ( x0 , y0 ) , assign point0 instanc variabl ( replac null valu instanc variabl initi ) . the second statement alloc second java.awt.point instanc ( x1 , y1 ) assign point1 instanc variabl .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Understanding_a_Java_Program"}
