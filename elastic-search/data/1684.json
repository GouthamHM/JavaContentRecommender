{"content": "There are cases where you might want to program using a different language (say, Python) and yet be able to generate Java byte-code (instead of the Python compiled code) to be run with the JVM. Many third-party programming language vendors provide compilers that can compile code written in their language to Java byte-code. For instance, Python developers can use Jython compilers to compile Python code to the Java byte-code format (as illustrated below).\n", "stemmed": "there case might want program use differ languag ( say , python ) yet abl gener java byte-cod ( instead python compil code ) run jvm . mani third-parti program languag vendor provid compil compil code written languag java byte-cod . for instanc , python develop use jython compil compil python code java byte-cod format ( illustr ) .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform"}
