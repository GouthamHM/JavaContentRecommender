{"content": "A nested class can be declared static. These classes are not bound to an instance of the outer defining class. A static nested class has no enclosing instance, and therefore cannot access instance variables and methods of the outer class. You do not specify an instance when creating a static inner class. This is equivalent to the inner classes in C++.\n", "stemmed": "A nest class declar static . these class bound instanc outer defin class .
