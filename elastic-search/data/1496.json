{"content": "Event-driven programming usually has a pretty large impact on the design of a program. Usually, a program has to be broken up into separate pieces to do event-driven programming (one piece for general processing and one or more others to deal with events that occur). Event-driven programming in Java is more complicated than non-event driven but it makes far more efficient use of the hardware and sometimes (like when developing a graphical user interface) dividing your code up into event-driven blocks actually fits very naturally with your program's structure.\n", "stemmed": "event-driven program usual pretti larg impact design program . usual , program broken separ piec event-driven program ( one piec gener process one other deal event occur ) . event-driven program java complic non-ev driven make far effici use hardwar sometim ( like develop graphic user interfac ) divid code event-driven block actual fit natur program 's structur .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Event_Handling"}
