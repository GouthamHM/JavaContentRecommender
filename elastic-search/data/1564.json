{"content": "JavaBeans interact with each other by means of events. Events are notifications, a component can give to other components, that something interesting has happened. An example for an event might be a mouse click on a button or the closing of a window. Beans can be source and target of events. To be informed about an event, a bean has to register at another Bean as a listener.\n", "stemmed": "javabean interact mean event . event notif , compon give compon , someth interest happen .
