{"content": "In Java, if you have used any reference to any other java object, then the class for that object will be automatically compiled, if that was not compiled already. These automatic  compilations are nested, and this continues until all classes are compiled that are needed to run the program. So it is usually enough to compile only the high level class, since all the dependent classes will be automatically compiled.\n", "stemmed": "In java , use refer java object , class object automat compil , compil alreadi . these automat compil nest , continu class compil need run program .
