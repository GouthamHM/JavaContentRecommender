{"content": "In the new way of error handling, functions/methods do not return error codes. Instead, when there is an error, an exception is thrown. The exceptions can be handled by the catch keyword at the end of a try block.  This way, the code that is calling the function does not need to be mangled with error checking codes, thus making the code more readable. This new way of error handling is called Exception handling.\n", "stemmed": "In new way error handl , functions/method return error code . instead , error , except thrown . the except handl catch keyword end tri block . thi way , code call function need mangl error check code , thu make code readabl . thi new way error handl call except handl .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Overview"}
