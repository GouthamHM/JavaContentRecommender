{"content": "To complete writing native method, you need to process your class with javah tool that will generate a header code in C. You then need to provide implementation of the header code, produce dynamically loadable library (.so under Linux, .dll under Windows) and load it (in the simplest case with System.load(library_file_name) . The code completion is trivial if only primitive types like integers are passed but gets more complex if it is needed to exchange strings or objects from the C code. In general, everything can be on C level, including creation of the new objects and calling back methods, written in java.\n", "stemmed": "To complet write nativ method , need process class javah tool gener header code C. you need provid implement header code , produc dynam loadabl librari ( .so linux , .dll window ) load ( simplest case system.load ( library_file_nam ) . the code complet trivial primit type like integ pass get complex need exchang string object C code .
