{"content": "System is a class in the package java.lang with a number of static members that are available to Java programs.  Two members that are useful for console output are System.out and System.err.  Both System.out and System.err are PrintStream objects.  PrintStream is a subclass of FilterOutputStream, itself a subclass of OutputStream (discussed above), and its main purpose is to translate a wide variety of data types into streams of bytes that represent that data in characters according to some encoding scheme.\n", "stemmed": "system class packag java.lang number static member avail java program . two member use consol output system.out system.err . both system.out system.err printstream object . printstream subclass filteroutputstream , subclass outputstream ( discuss ) , main purpos translat wide varieti data type stream byte repres data charact accord encod scheme .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Streams"}
