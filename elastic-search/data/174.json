{"content": "\nIn Java, programs are not compiled into executable files; they are compiled into bytecode (as discussed earlier), which the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) then executes at runtime. Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the javac compiler. The bytecode gets saved on the disk with the file extension .class. When the program is to be run, the bytecode is converted, using the just-in-time (JIT) compiler. The result is machine code which is then fed to the memory and is executed.\n", "stemmed": "In java , program compil execut file ; compil bytecod ( discuss earlier ) , jvm ( java virtual machin ) execut runtim . java sourc code compil bytecod use javac compil . the bytecod get save disk file extens .class . when program run , bytecod convert , use just-in-tim ( jit ) compil . the result machin code fed memori execut .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Compilation"}
