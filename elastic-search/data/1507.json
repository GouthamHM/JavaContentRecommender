{"content": "Another technique, the just-in-time (JIT) compiler, compiles the Java bytecode into native code at the time the program is run, and keep the compiled code to be used again and again.  More sophisticated VMs even use dynamic recompilation, in which the VM can analyze the behavior of the running program and selectively recompile and optimize critical parts of the program.  Both of these techniques allow the program to take advantage of the speed of native code without losing portability.\n", "stemmed": "anoth techniqu , just-in-tim ( jit ) compil , compil java bytecod nativ code time program run , keep compil code use . more sophist vm even use dynam recompil , VM analyz behavior run program select recompil optim critic part program . both techniqu allow program take advantag speed nativ code without lose portabl .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Overview"}
