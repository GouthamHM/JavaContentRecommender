{"content": "When an object is garbage-collected, the programmer may want to manually perform cleanup, such as closing any open input/output streams.  To accomplish this, the finalize() method is used.  Note that finalize() should never be manually called, except to call a super class' finalize method from a derived class' finalize method.  Also, we can not rely on when the finalize() method will be called.  If the java application exits before the object is garbage-collected, the finalize() method may never be called.\n", "stemmed": "when object garbage-collect , programm may want manual perform cleanup , close open input/output stream .
