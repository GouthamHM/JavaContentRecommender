{"content": "Java supports arrays, which are aggregate types which have a fixed element type (which can be any Java type) and an integral size. This program uses only one array, String[] args. This indicates that args has an array type and that the element type is String. The Java VM constructs and initializes the array that is passed to the main method. See arrays for more details on how to create arrays and access their size.\n", "stemmed": "java support array , aggreg type fix element type ( java type ) integr size . thi program use one array , string [ ] arg . thi indic arg array type element type string . the java VM construct initi array pass main method . see array detail creat array access size .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Understanding_a_Java_Program"}
