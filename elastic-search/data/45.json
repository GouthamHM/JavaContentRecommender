{"content": "Java programs often contain non-code files such as images and properties files. These are referred to generally as resources and stored in directories local to the classes in which they're used. For example, if the class com.example.ExampleApp uses the icon.png file, this file could be stored as /com/example/resources/icon.png. These resources present a problem when a program is compiled, because javac does not copy them to wherever the .class files are being compiled to (see above); it is up to the programmer to move the resource files and directories.\n", "stemmed": "java program often contain non-cod file imag properti file . these refer gener resourc store directori local class 're use . for exampl , class com.example.exampleapp use icon.png file , file could store /com/example/resources/icon.png . these resourc present problem program compil , javac copi wherev .class file compil ( see ) ; programm move resourc file directori .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Compilation"}
