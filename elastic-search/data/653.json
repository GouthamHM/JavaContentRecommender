{"content": "The wait method must be called inside of a block or method synchronized on the object.  This insures that there are no race conditions between wait and notify.  When the thread is placed in the wait list, the thread releases the object's mutex lock.  After the thread is removed from the wait list and added to the set of executable threads, it must acquire the object's mutex lock before continuing execution.\n", "stemmed": "the wait method must call insid block method synchron object . thi insur race condit wait notifi . when thread place wait list , thread releas object 's mutex lock . after thread remov wait list ad set execut thread , must acquir object 's mutex lock continu execut .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Classes,_Objects_and_Types"}
