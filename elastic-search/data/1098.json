{"content": "Eclipse is a Free and Open Source IDE, plus a developer tool framework that can be extended for a particular development need. IBM was behind its development, and it replaced IBM VisualAge tool. The idea was to create a standard look and feel that can be extended via plugins. The extensibility distinguishes Eclipse from other IDEs. Eclipse was also meant to compete with Microsoft Visual Studio tools. Microsoft tools give a standard way of developing code in the Microsoft world. Eclipse gives a similar standard way of developing code in the Java world, with a big success so far. With the online error checking only, coding can be sped up by at least 50% (coding does not include programming).\n", "stemmed": "eclips free open sourc ide , plu develop tool framework extend particular develop need . ibm behind develop , replac ibm visualag tool . the idea creat standard look feel extend via plugin . the extens distinguish eclips ide . eclips also meant compet microsoft visual studio tool . microsoft tool give standard way develop code microsoft world . eclips give similar standard way develop code java world , big success far . with onlin error check , code sped least 50 % ( code includ program ) .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_IDEs"}
