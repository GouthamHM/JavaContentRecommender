The JVM stores the code in memory, allocates memory for the static variables, and executes any static initialize block.  Memory is not allocated for the object member variables at this point, memory will be allocated for them when an instance of the class, an object, is created.\n", "stemmed": "when myobject.class file found , jvm 's class loader load class memori , creat java.lang.class object . the jvm store code memori , alloc memori static variabl , execut static initi block . memori alloc object member variabl point , memori alloc instanc class , object , creat .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Object_Lifecycle"}
