{"content": "All objects in Java programs are created on heap memory.  An object is created based on its class.  You can consider a class as a blueprint, template, or a description how to create an object.  When an object is created, memory is allocated to hold the object properties. An object reference pointing to that memory location is also created. To use the object in the future, that object reference has to be stored as a local variable or as an object member variable.\n", "stemmed": "all object java program creat heap memori .
