{"content": "So the compiler for the Java programming language checks, at compile time, that a program contains handlers for all application exceptions, by analyzing each method body. If, by executing the method body, an exception can be thrown to the caller, that exception must be declared. How does the compiler know whether a method body can throw an exception? That is easy. Inside the method body, there are calls to other methods; the compiler looks at each of their method signature, what exceptions they declared to throw.\n", "stemmed": "So compil java program languag check , compil time , program contain handler applic except , analyz method bodi .
