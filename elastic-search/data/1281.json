{"content": "However, a method can return only one value so what if you want to return more than one value from a method?\nYou can pass in an object reference to the method, and let the method modify the object properties so the modified values can be considered as an output value from the method.\nYou can also create an Object array inside the method, assign the return values and return the array to the caller. However, this gives a problem if you want to mix primitive data types and object references as the output values from the method.\n", "stemmed": "howev , method return one valu want return one valu method ? you pass object refer method , let method modifi object properti modifi valu consid output valu method . you also creat object array insid method , assign return valu return array caller . howev , give problem want mix primit data type object refer output valu method .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Methods"}
