{"content": "Also this feature makes it theoretically possible for a Java program to alter its own code during execution, in order to do some self-learning behavior. It would be more realistic to imagine, however, that a Java program would generate Java code before execution, and then, that code would be executed. With some feedback mechanism, the generated code could improve over time.\n", "stemmed": "also featur make theoret possibl java program alter code execut , order self-learn behavior .
