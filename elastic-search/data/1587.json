{"content": "...declares two instance fields. Instance fields represent named values that are allocated whenever an instance of the class is constructed. When a Java program creates a Distance instance, that instance will contain space for point0 and point1. When another Distance object is created, it will contain space for its own point0 and point1 values. The value of point0 in the first Distance object can vary independently of the value of point0 in the second Distance object.\n", "stemmed": "... declar two instanc field . instanc field repres name valu alloc whenev instanc class construct . when java program creat distanc instanc , instanc contain space point0 point1 . when anoth distanc object creat , contain space point0 point1 valu . the valu point0 first distanc object vari independ valu point0 second distanc object .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Understanding_a_Java_Program"}
