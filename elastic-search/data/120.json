{"content": "Of course we could implement this program quite simply with a loop in a main() method. But instead let's be a little more creative. Let's say that we want to divide our program neatly into classes, each with a responsibility of its own (like we should in a proper, object-oriented design). And let's imagine that we want it to be possible not only to calculate the sum of all the numbers read, but to perform any number of calculations on the same number stream. In fact, it should be possible to add new calculations with relative ease and without having to affect any previously existing code.\n", "stemmed": "Of cours could implement program quit simpli loop main ( ) method . but instead let 's littl creativ . let 's say want divid program neatli class , respons ( like proper , object-ori design ) . and let 's imagin want possibl calcul sum number read , perform number calcul number stream .
