{"content": "The Java JDK collection implementations are quite powerful and good, so it is unlikely that you will need to write your own. The usage of the different collections are the same but the implementations are different. If the existing collection implementations do not meet your needs, you can write your version of the implementation. Your version of the implementation just needs to implement the same java.util.Collection interface, then you can switch to using your implementation and the code that is using the collection does not need to be changed.\n", "stemmed": "the java jdk collect implement quit power good , unlik need write . the usag differ collect implement differ . If exist collect implement meet need , write version implement . your version implement need implement java.util.collect interfac , switch use implement code use collect need chang .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Collection"}
