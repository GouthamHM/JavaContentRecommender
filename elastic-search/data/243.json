{"content": "This method both computes the distance and prints it in one statement. The distance is computed with point0.distance(point1); distance() is an instance method of the java.awt.Point class (of which point0 and point1 are instances). The method operates on point0 (binding this to the object that point0 refers to during the execution of the method) and accepting another Point as a parameter. Actually, it is slightly more complicated than that, but we'll explain later. The result of the distance() method is a double precision floating point number.\n", "stemmed": "thi method comput distanc print one statement . the distanc comput point0.dist ( point1 ) ; distanc ( ) instanc method java.awt.point class ( point0 point1 instanc ) . the method oper point0 ( bind object point0 refer execut method ) accept anoth point paramet . actual , slightli complic , 'll explain later . the result distanc ( ) method doubl precis float point number .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Understanding_a_Java_Program"}
