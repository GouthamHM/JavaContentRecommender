{"content": "While it may seem convenient, it may cause problems if you make a typographical error.  For example, if you use the above import to use JFrame, but then type JFraim frame = new JFraim();, the Java compiler will report an error similar to \"Cannot find symbol: JFraim\".  Even though it seems as if it was imported,  the compiler is giving the error report at the first mention of JFraim, which is half-way through your code, instead of the point where you imported JFrame along with everything else in javax.swing.\n", "stemmed": "while may seem conveni , may caus problem make typograph error . for exampl , use import use jframe , type jfraim frame = new jfraim ( ) ; , java compil report error similar `` can find symbol : jfraim '' . even though seem import , compil give error report first mention jfraim , half-way code , instead point import jframe along everyth els javax.sw .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Packages"}
