{"content": "This error could have been found earlier, at compile time, by using generic types. The Generics have been added since JDK version 1.5. It is an enhancement to the type system of the Java language.  All collection implementations since 1.5 now have a parameterized type <E>.  The E refers to an Element type.  When a collection is created, the actual Element type will replace the E.  In the collection, the objects are now upcasted to E class.\n", "stemmed": "thi error could found earlier , compil time , use gener type . the gener ad sinc jdk version 1.5 .
