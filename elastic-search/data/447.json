{"content": "On the other hand, Java is also known as a hybrid language. While supporting object oriented programming (OOP), Java is not a pure OO language like Smalltalk or Ruby. Instead, Java offers both object types and primitive types. Primitive types are used for boolean, character, and numeric values and operations. This allows relatively good performance when manipulating numeric data, at the expense of flexibility. For example, you cannot subclass the primitive types and add new operations to them.\n", "stemmed": "On hand , java also known hybrid languag . while support object orient program ( oop ) , java pure OO languag like smalltalk rubi . instead , java offer object type primit type . primit type use boolean , charact , numer valu oper . thi allow rel good perform manipul numer data , expens flexibl . for exampl , subclass primit type add new oper .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Variables"}
