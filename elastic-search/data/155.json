{"content": "To start off your drawing experience, consider drawing the most basic shape \u2014 a line. A canvas when viewed upon with regards to drawing routines can be expressed as an inverted Cartesian coordinate system. A plane expressed by an x- and a y-axis. The origin point or \n\n\n\n(\n0\n,\n0\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (0,0)}\n\n being the top-left corner of a canvas and the visible area of the canvas being the Cartesian quadrant I or the positive-positive (+,+) quadrant. The further you go down from the top, the greater the value of y-coordinate on the y-axis, vice-versa for the x-axis as you move toward the right from the left. And unlike the values on a normal graph, the values appear to be positive. So a point at \n\n\n\n(\n10\n,\n20\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (10,20)}\n\n would be 10 pixels away from the left and 20 pixels away from the top, hence the format \n\n\n\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n\n.\n\n", "stemmed": "To start draw experi , consid draw basic shape \u2014 line .
