Example JNI functions are converting native arrays to/from Java arrays, converting native strings to/from Java strings, instantiating objects, throwing exceptions, etc.  Basically, anything that Java code can do can be done using JNIEnv, albeit with considerably less ease.\n", "stemmed": "the env pointer structur contain interfac jvm .
