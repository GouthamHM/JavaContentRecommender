{"content": "The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. Since Java 1.2, Java VM produces programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.\n", "stemmed": "the first implement languag use interpret virtual machin achiev portabl , mani implement still . these implement produc program run slowli fully-compil program creat typic c++ compil , languag suffer reput produc slow program . sinc java 1.2 , java VM produc program run much faster , use multipl techniqu .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Overview"}
