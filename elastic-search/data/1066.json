{"content": "Although both methods would be fit to call the method with the String parameter, it is the method with the nearest type that will be called instead. To be more accurate, it will call the method whose parameter type is a subclass of the parameter type of the other method. So, aObject will output Object. Beware! The parameter type is defined by the declared type of an object, not its instantiated type!\n", "stemmed": "although method would fit call method string paramet , method nearest type call instead .
