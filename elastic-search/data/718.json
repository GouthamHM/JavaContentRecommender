{"content": "The java.lang.Object.hashCode() method returns an integer (int). This integer can be used to distinguish objects although not completely. It quickly separates most of the objects and those with the same hash code are separated later in another way. It is used by the classes that provide associative arrays, for instance, those that implement the java.util.Map interface\n. They use the hash code to store the object in the associative array. A good hashCode implementation will return a hash code:\n", "stemmed": "the java.lang.object.hashcod ( ) method return integ ( int ) . thi integ use distinguish object although complet .
