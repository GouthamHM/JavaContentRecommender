{"content": "Such exceptional code that results in erroneous interpretations at program runtime usually results in errors that are called exceptions in Java. When the Java interpreter encounters an exceptional code, it halts execution and displays information about the error that occurs. This information is known as a stack trace. The stack trace in the above example tells us more about the error, such as the thread \u2014 \"main\" \u2014 where the exception occurred, the type of exception \u2014 java.lang.ArithmeticException, a comprehensible display message \u2014 / by zero, and the exact methods and the line numbers where the exception may have occurred.\n", "stemmed": "such except code result erron interpret program runtim usual result error call except java . when java interpret encount except code , halt execut display inform error occur . thi inform known stack trace . the stack trace exampl tell us error , thread \u2014 `` main '' \u2014 except occur , type except \u2014 java.lang.arithmeticexcept , comprehens display messag \u2014 / zero , exact method line number except may occur .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Throwing_and_Catching_Exceptions"}
