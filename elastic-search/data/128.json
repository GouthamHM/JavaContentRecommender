{"content": "The word Java, by itself, usually refers to the Java programming language which was designed for use with the Java platform. Programming languages are typically outside of the scope of the phrase \"platform\".  However, Oracle does not encourage the use of any other languages with the platform, and lists the Java programming language as a core part of the Java 2 platform. The language and runtime are therefore commonly considered a single unit.\n", "stemmed": "the word java , , usual refer java program languag design use java platform . program languag typic outsid scope phrase `` platform '' . howev , oracl encourag use languag platform , list java program languag core part java 2 platform . the languag runtim therefor commonli consid singl unit .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform"}
