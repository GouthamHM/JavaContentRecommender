{"content": "As Java is just a programming language that allows you to program the computer, it has multiple implementations available. The most popular implementation of JDK and JRE are the \"Oracle Java SE\" (formerly known as Sun JDK), maintained by Oracle as a commercial release. However another similarly popular implementation is the OpenJDK, with the benefit of being free software that could distribute freely under GPL v2 without the requirement of accepting the \"Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products and JavaFX\". The third option - the GCJ, as part of the GNU Compiler Collection, would also supply the JDK and JRE.\n", "stemmed": "As java program languag allow program comput , multipl implement avail . the popular implement jdk jre `` oracl java SE '' ( formerli known sun jdk ) , maintain oracl commerci releas . howev anoth similarli popular implement openjdk , benefit free softwar could distribut freeli gpl v2 without requir accept `` oracl binari code licens agreement java SE platform product javafx '' . the third option - gcj , part gnu compil collect , would also suppli jdk jre .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Installation"}
