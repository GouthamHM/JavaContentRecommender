{"content": "A big strength of the JavaBean component model is that it is designed for simplicity. Developing JavaBeans is very simple, because a lot of behavior (like the platform independence or packaging mechanism) is supported in the Java Programming Language by default. However, one can optionally equip beans with additional objects like BeanInfos or custom PropertyEditors to use the component model in a more flexible way. A second facility is that Sun designed the whole Swing GUI library according to the JavaBeans component model. Thereby Swing components can easily be composed in visual builder tools.\n", "stemmed": "A big strength javabean compon model design simplic . develop javabean simpl , lot behavior ( like platform independ packag mechan ) support java program languag default . howev , one option equip bean addit object like beaninfo custom propertyeditor use compon model flexibl way .
