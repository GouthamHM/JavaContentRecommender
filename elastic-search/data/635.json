{"content": "If we run the program, the same result is produced, but looking at the code, we immediately see the advantages of loops. Instead of executing 10 different lines of code, line 5 executes ten times. 10 lines of code have been reduced to just 4. Furthermore, we may change the number 10 to any number we like. Try it yourself, replace the 10 with your own number.\n", "stemmed": "If run program , result produc , look code , immedi see advantag loop . instead execut 10 differ line code , line 5 execut ten time . 10 line code reduc 4 . furthermor , may chang number 10 number like . tri , replac 10 number .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Loop_blocks"}
