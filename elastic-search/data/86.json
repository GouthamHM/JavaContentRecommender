{"content": "In most people's opinions, Java technology delivers reasonably well on all these goals. The language is not, however, without drawbacks. Java tends to be more high-level than similar languages (such as C++), which means that the Java language lacks features such as hardware-specific data types, low-level pointers to arbitrary memory addresses, or programming methods like operator overloading. Although these features are frequently abused or misused by programmers, they are also powerful tools. However, Java technology includes Java Native Interface (JNI), a way to call native code from Java language code. With JNI, it is still possible to use some of these features.\n", "stemmed": "In peopl 's opinion , java technolog deliv reason well goal . the languag , howev , without drawback . java tend high-level similar languag ( c++ ) , mean java languag lack featur hardware-specif data type , low-level pointer arbitrari memori address , program method like oper overload . although featur frequent abus misus programm , also power tool . howev , java technolog includ java nativ interfac ( jni ) , way call nativ code java languag code . with jni , still possibl use featur .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Overview"}
