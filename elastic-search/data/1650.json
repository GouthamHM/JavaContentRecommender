{"content": "Native Java applications are preserved in a special format called the byte-code. Byte-code remains the same, no matter what hardware architecture, operating system, or software platform it is running under. On a file-system, Java byte-code resides in files that have the .class (also known as a class file) or the .jar (also known as a Java archive) extension. To run byte-code, the JRE comes with a special tool (appropriately named java).\n", "stemmed": "nativ java applic preserv special format call byte-cod . byte-cod remain , matter hardwar architectur , oper system , softwar platform run .
