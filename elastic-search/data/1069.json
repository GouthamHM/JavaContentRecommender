{"content": "This may look boring to the developer but it forces them to think about all the checked exceptions and increase the code quality. This compile-time checking for the presence of exception handlers is designed to make the application developer life easier. To debug whether a particular thrown exception has a matching catch would be a long process. In conventional languages like C, and C++, a separate error handling debugging were needed. In Java we can be sure that when an application exception is thrown, that exception somewhere in the program is handled. In C, and C++, that has to be tested. In Java that does not need to be tested, so the freed up time can be used for more meaningful testing, testing the business features.\n", "stemmed": "thi may look bore develop forc think check except increas code qualiti . thi compile-tim check presenc except handler design make applic develop life easier .
