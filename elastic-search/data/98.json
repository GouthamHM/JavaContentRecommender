Perhaps your program must wait for some user input, or perhaps it must wait for data to be delivered over the network. Or perhaps something else. In any case, the program must wait for something to happen that is beyond the program's control: the program cannot make that event happen.\n", "stemmed": "No matter program languag paradigm use , chanc eventu run situat program wait extern event happen . perhap program must wait user input , perhap must wait data deliv network .
