{"content": "One of the main forces of adding this feature to Java was the wide spread use of XML descriptors to add additional information, metadata, for Java classes. Frameworks like EJB, JSF, Spring, Hibernate were heavily using external XML descriptors. The problem of those external descriptors was that those files are out of reach of the Java compiler and for that reason compiler type checking could not be used. A small spelling mistake bug in a huge XML descriptor file is hard to locate and fix. On the other hand the Java annotations use the Java compiler type checking features so spelling mistakes in annotation names will be caught by the Java compiler.\n", "stemmed": "one main forc ad featur java wide spread use xml descriptor add addit inform , metadata , java class . framework like ejb , jsf , spring , hibern heavili use extern xml descriptor . the problem extern descriptor file reach java compil reason compil type check could use .
