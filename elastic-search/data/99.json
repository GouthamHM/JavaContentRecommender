{"content": "Quite possibly, the most important part of the JRE is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM acts like a virtual processor, enabling Java applications to be run on the local system. Its main purpose is to interpret (read translate) the received byte-code and make it appear as native code. The older Java architecture used this process of interpretation to execute Java byte-code. Even though the process of interpretation brought the WORA principle to diverse machines, it had a drawback \u2014 it consumed a lot of time and clocked the system processor intensively to load an application.\n", "stemmed": "quit possibl , import part jre java virtual machin ( jvm ) . the jvm act like virtual processor , enabl java applic run local system . it main purpos interpret ( read translat ) receiv byte-cod make appear nativ code . the older java architectur use process interpret execut java byte-cod . even though process interpret brought wora principl divers machin , drawback \u2014 consum lot time clock system processor intens load applic .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform"}
