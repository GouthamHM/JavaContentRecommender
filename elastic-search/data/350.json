{"content": "Sometime it is desirable to catch all exceptions for logging purposes, then throw them back in. For example, in servlet programming when an application server calls the server getLastModified(), we want to monitor that no exceptions happened during the serving of the request. The application has its own logging separate from the server logging so the runtime exceptions would just go through without being detected by the application. The following code checks all exceptions, logs them and throws them back again.\n", "stemmed": "sometim desir catch except log purpos , throw back . for exampl , servlet program applic server call server getlastmodifi ( ) , want monitor except happen serv request . the applic log separ server log runtim except would go without detect applic . the follow code check except , log throw back .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Unchecked_Exceptions"}
