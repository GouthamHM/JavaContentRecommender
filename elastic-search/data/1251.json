{"content": "It is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings be consistent with equals. This is because sorted sets (and sorted maps) without explicit comparators behave \"strangely\" when they are used with elements (or keys) whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals. In particular, such a sorted set (or sorted map) violates the general contract for set (or map), which is defined in terms of the equals method.\n", "stemmed": "It strongli recommend ( though requir ) natur order consist equal . thi sort set ( sort map ) without explicit compar behav `` strang '' use element ( key ) whose natur order inconsist equal .
