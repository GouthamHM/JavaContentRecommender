{"content": "The Java platform is an isolated entity, a space on your OS in a way, where everything outside this system is its environment. The interaction between the system and its environment is a two-way dialog of sorts. Either the system receives messages from its environment, or it conveys its messages to the same. When a message is received by the system, it is called an input, its opposite is an output. On a whole, this communication is termed input/output abbreviated as I/O.\n", "stemmed": "the java platform isol entiti , space OS way , everyth outsid system environ . the interact system environ two-way dialog sort . either system receiv messag environ , convey messag . when messag receiv system , call input , opposit output .
