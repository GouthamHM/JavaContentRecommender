{"content": "Introduced in 1996 for the Solaris, Windows, Mac OS Classic and Linux, Java was initially released as the Java Development Kit 1.0 (JDK 1.0). This included the Java runtime (the virtual machine and the class libraries), and the development tools (e.g., the Java compiler). Later, Sun also provided a runtime-only package, called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The first name stuck, however, so usually people refer to a particular version of Java by its JDK version (e.g., JDK 1.0).\n", "stemmed": "introduc 1996 solari , window , mac OS classic linux , java initi releas java develop kit 1.0 ( jdk 1.0 ) . thi includ java runtim ( virtual machin class librari ) , develop tool ( e.g. , java compil ) . later , sun also provid runtime-onli packag , call java runtim environ ( jre ) . the first name stuck , howev , usual peopl refer particular version java jdk version ( e.g. , jdk 1.0 ) .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/History"}
