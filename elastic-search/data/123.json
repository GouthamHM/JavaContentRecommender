{"content": "In most modern operating systems, a large body of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer's job.  This code is typically provided as a set of dynamically loadable libraries that applications can call at runtime.  Because the Java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system, applications cannot rely on any of the existing libraries.  Instead, the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of standard class libraries, containing much of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems.\n", "stemmed": "In modern oper system , larg bodi reusabl code provid simplifi programm 's job . thi code typic provid set dynam loadabl librari applic call runtim . becaus java platform depend specif oper system , applic reli exist librari . instead , java platform provid comprehens set standard class librari , contain much reusabl function commonli found modern oper system .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform"}
