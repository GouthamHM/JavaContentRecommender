{"content": "From Java 1.4, the stack trace is encapsulated into an array of a java class called java.lang.StackTraceElement.\nThe stack trace element array returned by Throwable.getStackTrace() method. Each element represents a single stack frame. All stack frames except for the one at the top of the stack represent a method invocation. The frame at the top of the stack represents the execution point at which the stack trace was generated. Typically, this is the point at which the throwable corresponding to the stack trace was created.\n", "stemmed": "from java 1.4 , stack trace encapsul array java class call java.lang.stacktraceel . the stack trace element array return throwable.getstacktrac ( ) method . each element repres singl stack frame . all stack frame except one top stack repres method invoc . the frame top stack repres execut point stack trace gener . typic , point throwabl correspond stack trace creat .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Stack_trace"}
