{"content": "In the Code listing 4.10, the class Car inherits from Vehicle, which means that the attributes speed and numberOfSeats are present in the class Car, whereas they are defined in the class Vehicle. Also, the constructor defined in the class Car allows to initialize those attributes.\nIn Java, the inheritance mechanism allows to define a class hierarchy with all the classes. Without explicit inheritance, a class implicitly inherits from the Object class. This Object class is the root of the class hierarchy.\n", "stemmed": "In code list 4.10 , class car inherit vehicl , mean attribut speed numberofseat present class car , wherea defin class vehicl . also , constructor defin class car allow initi attribut .
