{"content": "Instance initializers are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for instance (non-static) fields.  Instance field initializers and instance initializers are executed in the order declared. Both instance initializers and instance field initializers are executed during the invocation of a constructor.  The initializers are executed immediately after the superclass constructor and before the body of the constructor.\n", "stemmed": "instanc initi block code execut time initi instanc ( non-stat ) field . instanc field initi instanc initi execut order declar . both instanc initi instanc field initi execut invoc constructor . the initi execut immedi superclass constructor bodi constructor .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Defining_Classes"}
