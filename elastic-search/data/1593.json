{"content": "The four arguments that are being passed into the method are, in order of appearance, the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, width and the height. Hence, the resultant rectangle would start painting at the point on the screen 10 pixels from the left and 10 from the top and would be a 100 pixel wide and a 100 pixel in height. To save the argument here, the above drawing is that of a square with equal sides but squares are drawn using the same method and there is no such method as drawSquare(int, int, int)\n\n", "stemmed": "the four argument pass method , order appear , x-coordin , y-coordin , width height . henc , result rectangl would start paint point screen 10 pixel left 10 top would 100 pixel wide 100 pixel height .
