{"content": "Some programmers also complain about its lack of multiple inheritance, a powerful feature of several object-oriented languages, among others C++. The Java language separates inheritance of type and implementation, allowing inheritance of multiple type definitions through interfaces, but only single inheritance of type implementation via class hierarchies. This allows most of the benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding many of its dangers. In addition, through the use of concrete classes, abstract classes, as well as interfaces, a Java language programmer has the option of choosing full, partial, or zero implementation for the object type he defines, thus ensuring maximum flexibility in application design.\n", "stemmed": "some programm also complain lack multipl inherit , power featur sever object-ori languag , among other c++ . the java languag separ inherit type implement , allow inherit multipl type definit interfac , singl inherit type implement via class hierarchi . thi allow benefit multipl inherit avoid mani danger .
