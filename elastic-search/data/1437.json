{"content": "Input streams acquire bytes for our programmed java application/program (e.g. a file, an array, a keyboard or monitor, etc.). InputStream is an abstract class that represents a source of byte data.  It has a read() method, which returns the next byte in the stream and a close() method, which should be called by a program when that program is done with the stream.  The read() method is overloaded, and can take a byte array to read to.  It has a skip() method that can skip a number of bytes, and an available() method that a program can use to determine the number of bytes immediately available to be read, as not all the data is necessarily ready immediately.  As an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated, but describes the general behavior of an input stream.  A few examples of concrete subclasses would be ByteArrayInputStream, which reads from a byte array, and FileInputStream, which reads byte data from a file.\n", "stemmed": "input stream acquir byte program java application/program ( e.g . file , array , keyboard monitor , etc. ) . inputstream abstract class repres sourc byte data .
