{"content": "Since version 1.2, the JRE features a more robust JVM. Instead of interpreting byte-code, it down-right converts the code straight into equivalent native code for the local system. This process of conversion is called just-in-time compilation or JIT-compilation. This process only occurs when the byte-code is executed for the first time. Unless the byte-code itself is changed, the JVM uses the compiled version of the byte-code on every successive execution. Doing so saves a lot of time and processor effort, allowing applications to execute much faster at the cost of a small delay on first execution.\n", "stemmed": "sinc version 1.2 , jre featur robust jvm . instead interpret byte-cod , down-right convert code straight equival nativ code local system . thi process convers call just-in-tim compil jit-compil . thi process occur byte-cod execut first time . unless byte-cod chang , jvm use compil version byte-cod everi success execut . do save lot time processor effort , allow applic execut much faster cost small delay first execut .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform"}
