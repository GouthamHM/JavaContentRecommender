{"content": "Character literals are constant valued character expressions embedded in a Java program. Java characters are sixteen bit Unicode characters, ranging from 0 to 65535. Character literals are expressed in Java as a single quote, the character, and a closing single quote ('a', '7', '$', '\u03c0'). Character literals have the type char, an unsigned integer primitive type. Character literals may be safely promoted to larger integer types such as int and long. Character literals used where a short or byte is called for must be cast to short or byte since truncation may occur.\n", "stemmed": "charact liter constant valu charact express embed java program . java charact sixteen bit unicod charact , rang 0 65535 . charact liter express java singl quot , charact , close singl quot ( 'a ' , '7 ' , ' $ ' , '\u03c0 ' ) . charact liter type char , unsign integ primit type . charact liter may safe promot larger integ type int long . charact liter use short byte call must cast short byte sinc truncat may occur .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Literals"}
