{"content": "There are three overloaded versions of the wait method to support different ways to specify the timeout value: java.lang.Object.wait(), java.lang.Object.wait(long) and java.lang.Object.wait(long, int).  The first method uses a timeout value of zero (0), which means that the wait does not timeout; the second method takes the number of milliseconds as a timeout; the third method takes the number of nanoseconds as a timeout, calculated as 1000000 * timeout + nanos.\n", "stemmed": "there three overload version wait method support differ way specifi timeout valu : java.lang.object.wait ( ) , java.lang.object.wait ( long ) java.lang.object.wait ( long , int ) . the first method use timeout valu zero ( 0 ) , mean wait timeout ; second method take number millisecond timeout ; third method take number nanosecond timeout , calcul 1000000 * timeout + nano .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Classes,_Objects_and_Types"}
