{"content": "The else if statement is useful in this case because if one of the conditionals is true, the other must be false.  Keep in mind that if one is true, the other will not execute.  For example, if the statement at line 2 contained in the first conditional were changed to x = 3;, the second conditional, the else if, would still not execute.  However, when dealing with primitive types in conditional statements, it is more desirable to use switch statements rather than multiple else if statements.\n", "stemmed": "the els statement use case one condit true , must fals . keep mind one true , execut . for exampl , statement line 2 contain first condit chang x = 3 ; , second condit , els , would still execut . howev , deal primit type condit statement , desir use switch statement rather multipl els statement .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Statements"}
