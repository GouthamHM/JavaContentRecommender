{"content": "In the above example, a simple method is used to define precisely where to place the line on the Cartesian scale of the canvas. The drawLine(int,int,int,int) asks you to put four arguments, appearing in order, the x1 coordinate, the y1 coordinate, the x2 coordinate and the y2 coordinate. Running the program will show a simple black line diagonally going across the canvas.\n\n", "stemmed": "In exampl , simpl method use defin precis place line cartesian scale canva . the drawlin ( int , int , int , int ) ask put four argument , appear order , x1 coordin , y1 coordin , x2 coordin y2 coordin . run program show simpl black line diagon go across canva .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Graphics/Drawing_shapes"}
