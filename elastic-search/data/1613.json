{"content": "Both the main() and intValue() methods are static methods. The static keyword tells the compiler to create a single memory space associated with the class.  Each individual object instantiated has its own private state variables and methods but use the same static methods and members common to the single class object created by the compiler when the first class object is instantiated or created.  This means that the method executes in a static or non-object context \u2014 there is no implicit separate instance available when the static methods run from various objects, and the special variable this is not available. As such, static methods cannot access instance methods or instance fields (such as printDistance()) or point0) directly. The main() method can only invoke the instance method printDistance() method via an instance reference such as dist.\n", "stemmed": "both main ( ) intvalu ( ) method static method . the static keyword tell compil creat singl memori space associ class . each individu object instanti privat state variabl method use static method member common singl class object creat compil first class object instanti creat . thi mean method execut static non-object context \u2014 implicit separ instanc avail static method run variou object , special variabl avail .
