{"content": "Versions of Java prior to J2SE 1.4 only supported stream-based blocking I/O. This required a thread per stream being handled, as no other processing could take place while the active thread blocked waiting for input or output.  This was a major scalability and performance issue for anyone needing to implement any Java network service.  Since the introduction of NIO (New I/O) in J2SE 1.4, this scalability problem has been rectified by the introduction of a non-blocking I/O framework (though there are a number of open issues in the NIO API as implemented by Oracle).\n", "stemmed": "version java prior j2se 1.4 support stream-bas block i/o . thi requir thread per stream handl , process could take place activ thread block wait input output . thi major scalabl perform issu anyon need implement java network servic . sinc introduct nio ( new i/o ) j2se 1.4 , scalabl problem rectifi introduct non-block i/o framework ( though number open issu nio api implement oracl ) .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Streams"}
