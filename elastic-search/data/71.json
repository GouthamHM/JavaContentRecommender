{"content": "Objects passed in as parameters to the remote objects's methods will be passed by value. If the remote object changes the passed-in object values, it won't be reflected on the client side, this is opposite what happens when a local object is called. Objects that used as parameters for remote methods invocation must implement the java.io.Serializable interface, as they are going to be serialized when passed through the network, and a new object will be created on the other side.\n", "stemmed": "object pass paramet remot object 's method pass valu .
