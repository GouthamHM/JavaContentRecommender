{"content": "The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is the compiler that converts the byte-code to machine code. It compiles byte-code once and the compiled machine code is re-used again and again, to speed up execution.  Early Java compilers compiled the byte-code to machine code each time it was used, but more modern compilers cache this machine code for reuse on the machine. Even then, java's JIT compiling was still faster than an \"interpreter-language\", where code is compiled from high level language, instead of from byte-code each time it was used.\n", "stemmed": "the just-in-tim ( jit ) compil compil convert byte-cod machin code .
