{"content": "\nThe integer primitive type with the largest range of value is the long, from -263 to 263-1. If you need greater or lesser values, you have to use the BigInteger class in the package java.math. A BigInteger object can represent any integer (as large as the RAM on the computer can hold) as it is not mapped on a primitive type. Respectively, you need to use the BigDecimal class for great decimal numbers.\n", "stemmed": "the integ primit type largest rang valu long , -263 263-1 .
