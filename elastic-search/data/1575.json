{"content": "The syntax of a Java class is the characters, symbols and their structure used to code the class. Java programs consist of a sequence of tokens. There are different kinds of tokens. For example, there are word tokens such as class and public which represent keywords (in purple above) \u2014 special words with reserved meaning in Java. Other words such as Distance, point0, x1, and printDistance are not keywords but identifiers (in grey). Identifiers have many different uses in Java but primarily they are used as names. Java also has tokens to represent numbers, such as 1 and 3; these are known as literals (in orange). String literals (in blue), such as  \"Distance between \", consist of zero or more characters embedded in double quotes, and operators (in red) such as + and = are used to express basic computation such as addition or String concatenation or assignment. There are also left and right braces ({ and }) which enclose blocks. The body of a class is one such block. Some tokens are punctuation, such as periods . and commas , and semicolons ;. You use whitespace such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, to separate tokens. For example, whitespace is required between keywords and identifiers: publicstatic is a single identifier with twelve characters, not two Java keywords.\n", "stemmed": "the syntax java class charact , symbol structur use code class . java program consist sequenc token . there differ kind token . for exampl , word token class public repres keyword ( purpl ) \u2014 special word reserv mean java . other word distanc , point0 , x1 , printdist keyword identifi ( grey ) . identifi mani differ use java primarili use name . java also token repres number , 1 3 ; known liter ( orang ) . string liter ( blue ) , `` distanc `` , consist zero charact embed doubl quot , oper ( red ) + = use express basic comput addit string concaten assign . there also left right brace ( { } ) enclos block . the bodi class one block . some token punctuat , period . comma , semicolon ; . you use whitespac space , tab , newlin , separ token . for exampl , whitespac requir keyword identifi : publicstat singl identifi twelv charact , two java keyword .", "link": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Understanding_a_Java_Program"}
